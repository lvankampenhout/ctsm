One-line Summary: Fix LND_TUNING_MODE for fully coupled case, update some README files/PTCLM

Purpose of changes
------------------

Fix problem with default LND_TUNING_MODE for cases coupled to CAM. Update some of the README
files. And also bring in a PTCLM version that will work in the new CTSM git checkout directory
structure.

Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): 
#255 PTCLMmkdata doesn't work in the CLM git checkout

Known bugs found in this tag (include github issue ID):

#262 hirespft option for mksurfdata.pl doesn't work


Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions): None

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables): None

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): None

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): None

Substantial timing or memory changes: None

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance): None

Changes to tests or testing: None

One-line Summary: Initial version of CLM5.0

This is the initial science version of CLM5.0.

Developments for CLM5.0 build on the progress made in CLM4.5. Most major components of the model have been updated with particularly
notable changes made to soil and plant hydrology, snow density, river modeling, carbon and nitrogen cycling and coupling, and crop
modeling.
The updates to CLM science are documented here:

https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/Introduction/CLM50_Tech_Note_Introduction.html#clm5-0

This version has production versions of CLM5.0 CMIP6 land-use change files for 1850, historical, and 2000. It has preliminary
versions of CMIP6 forcing files for Nitrogen deposition and population density. Further updates are needed for prescribed aerosols,
and future scenarios.

Spunup initial conditions are provided for several CLM physics and forcing combinations from simulations run at 1-degree resolution
(fv 0.9x1.25 with g1xv6 ocean mask).
